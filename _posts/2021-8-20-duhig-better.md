# 30 Second Overview
This book is about maximizing your productivity and effectiveness in all areas of your life.

# Summary

## Motivation
* Key concept(s): 
   * To motivate ourselves, we must feel like we are in control
   * When people are in control, they work harder and push themselves more
   * Making decisions proves to us that we are in control
   * Internal locus of control - the belief that your actions can influence your destiny (external is opposite)
   * Make a chore into a decision by asking “why am I doing this” (link it to something you care about)
* Putting into practice: 
   * Give people opportunities to make choices that provide them with a sense of autonomy and self-determination
   * Make the choices meaningful: show them they are in control and connect them to the greater purpose
   * Reward initiative, congratulate self-motivation

## Teams
* Key concept(s): 
   * Manage the “how” of teams, not the “who”
   * Psychological safety is the key norm that promotes teamwork and productivity
      * Encourage folks to speak up
      * Feel like you can expose your vulnerabilities
      * Suggest ideas without fear of retribution
      * Discourage people from making harsh judgements
      * Encourage risk taking and do not judge if they fail
   * Good teams typically have two characteristics: 
      * Everyone speaks in roughly the same amount (equal distribution of conversational turn-taking)
      * High average social sensitivity - groups skilled in intuiting how members feel based on tone of voice, how they hold themselves, and facial expressions
   * 5 key norms (Google synthesis): 
      * Teams need to believe their work is important
      * Teams need to feel their work is personally meaningful
      * Teams need clear goals and defined roles
      * Team members need to know they can depend on one another
      * Most importantly, teams need psychological safety
* Putting into practice: 
   * Two key aspects: 
      * Give everyone a voice
      * Find people that are sensitive enough to listen
   * Demonstrate psychological safety by a team leader
      * Go out of your way to make someone feel listened to
      * Ask others to lookout for my mistakes
      * Ask folks who you haven’t heard from in a while for their opinion
   * Other actions/behaviors that support the 2 key aspects: 
      * Don’t interrupt people
      * Summarize what people say to show you are listening
      * Admit they don’t know
      * Don’t end meetings until everyone has spoken
      * Encourage people to express their frustrations and encourage teammates to respond in non-judgemental ways
      * Call out intergroup conflicts and resolve them through open discussion

## Focus
* Key concept(s): 
   * Create mental models (forecasts, visualizations) of future interactions, meetings, behaviors and use that to (1) alert us if something is not in line with our thinking and, if so, (2) react more calmly and appropriately
   * Mental models provide structure for the massive amount of information that constantly surrounds us
* Putting into practice: 
   * Work on just a few projects (~4-5), different to those done in the past, typically earlier stage projects w/access to earlier info, and create theories about how things work (conversations, failed projects, successes, etc.) 
   * Tell yourself stories about what is going on around you; narrate your life so you can quickly respond if needed
   * Visualize what you are about to do (for the day, project, etc.) so you can quickly notice when you are distracted and re-focus
      * E.g., envision a conversation later, what will you start with, what questions will be raised, how will you respond
   * Hire people who describe their experiences as some kind of narrative; they likely have an instinct for connecting the dots and understanding how the world works at a deeper level

## Goals
* Key concept(s): 
   * Cognitive closure can help us drive results and complete tasks - use to our advantage
   * Structuring goals as SMART goals lead to a higher probability of achieving them
      * However, not all SMART goals are worth doing (need to ensure the goal is worth it first)
   * Stretch goals, paired with SMART frameworks, can inspire ambitious goals without making them seem unrealistic
      * Need to have a system to break it down into concrete, understandable actions
* Putting into practice: 
   * Define stretch goal, then define SMART subgoals (proximal goals) that get you incrementally towards that goal
   * As your are completing these goals, make sure you step back and reflect on them to make sure they are still relevant, appropriate, and worth doing (ask “and if not?”)

## Managing others 
* Key concept(s): 
   * Commitment culture is usually more robust and higher probability of success
   * Lean manufacturing - push decision making to lowest possible level (local experts) which inspires trust and gives folks control which then encourages them to work harder
   * Employees work smarter and better when they believe they have more decision making authority AND when they believe their colleagues are committed to their success
* Putting into practice: 
   * Put in place systems to enable individuals to have more decision making authority
   
## Decision making
* Key concept(s):
   * Forecasting well means thinking of the future as an array of outcomes with specific probabilities attached to them. Combine them into a single number by averaging them
   * Making good choices relies on good forecasts. Good forecasts rely on exposing ourselves to as many successes and failures as possible (avoid confirmation bias)
   * Think probabilistically, envision various contradictory futures in your head, and get exposure to lots of successes/failures to develop intuition about which forecasts are likely to come true
* Putting into practice: 
   * Manually calculate probabilities for scenarios
   * Review past experiences and figure out why it was successful or failed

## Innovation 
* Key concept(s):
   * Creative process is usually combining existing tech/solutions/ideas in new creative ways or for new use cases
   * Often innovation are spurred by your own experiences and emotions (e.g., frustration)
   * Creativity sometimes needs novelty, surprise, disruption (analogous to biological systems)
   * Creativity can’t be automatically generated, but you can manage the creative process by
      * Be sensitive to your own experiences, reflect on how they make you feel
      * Stress/anxiety during creation is not a bad thing but rather a sign that we can be flexible and embrace creative desperation
      * Breakthroughs can blind us to alternatives and we need to maintain some distance from what we create 
* Putting into practice: 
   * Implement the creative process applying the above 3 techniques

## Absorbing data
* Key concept(s):
   * We absorb data best if we can break it down into series of smaller and smaller pieces (scaffolding), otherwise we get data blindness and don’t absorb anything
   * Asking yourself a few questions (hypotheses) about the data can help you break it down and understand it better in sequential steps
   * Engineering design process forces us to search for info, brainstorm solutions, look for different insights, test ideas helps us achieve disfluency by reframing the decision (otherwise we can get stuck in our original frame of reference which may not be the full picture, just our first thought)
* Putting into practice: 
   * To learn something from the data, you have to do something with it (plot it, write down the ideas, synthesize and explain it)

## Additional Notes on Management

1. Good coach
2. Empowers others (no micromanaging)
3. Expresses interest and concern in subordinates success and well-being
4. Results oriented
5. Listens and shares information
6. Helps with career development
7. Clear vision and strategy
8. Has key technical skills
