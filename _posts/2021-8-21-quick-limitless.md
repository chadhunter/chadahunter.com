## Mindset (What?)
* Key concept(s): 
   * 7 lies of learning
      * Intelligence is fixed
         * Fixed vs growth mindset
         * Growth mindset - we have the power to improve anything
         * IQ is static measurement and misses creativity, practical intelligence (street smarts), and emotional intelligence
      * We only use 10% of our brains
         * That is a myth and we use 100% of our brain
         * Learn to use your whole brain in the best way possible (efficiently, effectively)
      * Mistakes are failures
         * A person who has never made a mistake has never tried something new
         * No one remembers you for your mistakes, only for your successes
         * Mistakes = trying new things
         * Mistakes don’t mean failure and you are not your mistakes
         * There is no such thing as failure, only failure to learn
      * Knowledge is power
         * Knowledge is not power, it’s potential power
         * Knowledge x Action = Power
      * Learning new things is difficult
         * Learning can be hard since you are pushing yourself
         * With the right tools/techniques (consistency, methods, motivation), it can be much easier and very rewarding
      * The criticism of other people matters
         * Creating the life you want can be scary
         * Children learn fastest since they aren’t worried about what others think if they fail and get back up every time 
         * Don’t take criticism from someone you wouldn’t take advice from 
         * It's not your job to like, love, or respect me. It’s mine.
      * Genius is born
         * Genius is not born, it is made through deep practice

## Motivation (Why)
* Key concept(s): 
   * Motivation = Purpose x Energy x S3 (small simple steps), and flow
   * Propose
      * Purpose = why you do what you do
      * Goal is the point one wishes to achieve, purpose is the reason one aims at to achieve that goal
      * Goals should be SMART
      * Make sure your goals fit with your emotions/HEART
         * Heathy - support your greater well-being (mind, body, emotion)
         * Enduring - inspire and sustain you (aligned with your purpose)
         * Alluring - Your goals should be so exciting they pull you to work on them
         * Relevant - aligned with your purpose, core values, and current challenges
         * Truth - make sure its something you really want, not just what others do or what you see
      * Passion is what inspires you on the inside, purpose is what you’re here to share with the world
         * Typically, everyone’s purpose is to help other people through our passion
      * Writing/saying “I am” statements can help you define yourself and create internal motivation
      * Be very focused with your time/energy - what aligns with your purpose and use that to decide if you should not do other things
      * Motivation
         * What is it? Set of emotions (painful and pleasurable) that acts as the fuel for our actions
         * Where does it come from? From purpose, fully feeling and associated with the consequences of our actions or inactions
      * Write down the pros/cons of acting or not acting
         * Pros (advantages) - what will happen if you do this thing (e.g., apply the learnings in this book)
         * Cons (disadvantages) - use (hypothetical) pain to drive emotions (e.g., what happens if I don’t do this thing)
   * Energy
      * Needed to turn purpose and S3 into action
      * 10 recommendations
         * Good brain diet (avocados, blueberries, broccoli,dark chocolate, eggs, green leafy veggies, salmon, turmeric, walnuts, water)
         * Brain nutrients (phospholipid DHA, B vitamins, etc.); full list on his website
         * Exercise, aerobic
         * Killing ANTs - automatic negative thoughts, remove them to remove limitations
         * Clean environment - clean air, remove clutter, etc.
         * Positive peer group - who you spend time with is who you become (closest 5 friends)
         * Brain protection (helmet, sports, etc.)
         * New learning - keep learning to keep your brain plastic/supple
         * Stress - find ways to avoid/reduce stress; when you are stressed, it builds up that primitive part of your brain while your more complex part isnt used as much
         * Sleep - get the quantity and quality of sleep you need
            * Exercise helps
            * Mediation helps (do it routinely; go to website for a video of Jim’s coach)
   * Small Simple Steps
      * Zeigarnik effect - uncompleted tasks create a level of tension that keeps that task at the front of our minds until it is completed
      * Break down tasks into smaller steps such that we can feel good about finishing them, avoid guilt of having them pile up, and get us closer to accomplishing the bigger task
      * SSS lead to habits, habits lead to who you are (~50% of what we do daily are habits)
      * Habit loop has 4 components
         * Cue
         * Craving
         * Response
         * Reward
      * Create morning routine: starts with positive affirmations the night before, remembering dreams, get hydrated, quick exercise, good breakfast, and whatever your top goals are
   * Flow
      * Four phases: 
         * Struggle - learning what you need to do, getting things set up; doesn’t feel like flow
         * Relax - taking a break after the struggle of getting everything lined up
         * Flow - superman experience
         * Consolidation - coming down from your high, wrapping it up
      * Finding flow
         * Eliminate distractions - avoid switching costs, interruptions of phone/email/etc.; do anything that you absolutely need to do before jumping into it
         * Time - you need 60-120 mins (ideally 120 mins) to really get into it (>45 mins to hit it)
         * Do something you love (and believe in)
         * Have clear goals - have a clear plan and objective to tackle (mental model)
         * Challenge yourself a little

## Methods (How) 
* Key concept(s): 
   * 5 key meta-learning skills: focus, study, memory, speed reading, thinking
   * Focus
      * Concentration is key
         * Practice: focus on a single task (whatever it may be) and eliminate physical clutter
         * Calm the mind
            * Breathing (4-7-8 technique)
            * Do something that has been causing the stress
            * Schedule time for distractions (worry time); be specific and tell yourself “I will worry/address that at 4:15pm)
   * Study
      * Employ active recall - read/study something, then make yourself recall the key points/info (4x)
      * Spaced repetition - repeat the recall / material at increasing durations, focusing on your gaps
      * Manage your state - you learn better when you feel good, positive, good posture (oxygen)
      * Use your smell - use smell to help you recall and connect memories/info
      * Music - music improves mood, better mood equates in more learning; baroque music is good for focus/concentration
      * Listen w/whole brain - Halt (focus on them and nothing else), Empathy (understand where the speaker is coming from and why), Anticipate (engage and anticipate what is about to be said), Review (ask questions, take notes, reflect on it, summarize it)
      * Take note - summarize info based on what your goals are; capture/create (left/right of page), review notes immediately after 
   * Memory
      * MOM - motivation, observation (attention), methods
      * Active memory is key 
      * Visualization 
         * Your visual memory is very powerful. By seeing the pictures a story paints and not just the words that represent those pictures, you create a stronger means by which to remember.
      * Association 
         * This is the key to memory and all of learning: In order to learn any new piece of information, it must be associated with something you already know.
      * Emotion 
         * Adding emotion makes something memorable. Information by itself is forgettable, but information combined with emotion becomes a long-term memory.
      * Location 
         * We are really good at recalling places because as hunter-gatherers, we didn’t need to remember numbers and words, but we needed to remember where things were. We needed to know where the clean water was, where the fertile soil was, where the food was. If you can associate something with a place, you’re more likely to remember it.
      * Tools: 
         * If you need to remember a list of things, turn it into a vivid story that has each of the items on the list 
         * If you need to remember talking points, associate them with specific items along a journey that you are very familiar with (like walking through your house) 
         * Remember names: listen, repeat it, use it, visualize it, ask for its origin, end the conversation with it 
         * Remember words / vocabulary: turn a word into words that you can picture and sound like it (Armstrong = arm strong)
   * Reading
      * Why?
         * Reading kicks your brain into gear.
         * Reading improves your memory.
         * Reading improves your focus.
         * Reading improves your vocabulary.
         * Reading improves your imagination.
         * Reading improves your understanding.
      * Speed Reading 
         * Assessment: read for 2 mins and count words 
      * Challenges: 
         * Regression 
         * Outdated skills 
         * Subvocalization
      * How to improve it: 
         * Visual pacer 
         * Exercise 4-3-2-1 speed drills
         * Expand peripheral vision
         * Counting 
      * Practice everyday (speed drills) until you’re at a speed you want to be at, read daily to keep your brain in shape
      * Take my speed-reading online masterclass (free) at www.jimkwik.com/reading
   * Thinking
