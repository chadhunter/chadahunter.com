# 30 Second Overview
This book is about maximizing your productivity and effectiveness in all areas of your life.

# Summary
Quote: “The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediate or in the long run.”

The Principles
* Principle #1: Clutter is costly. Digital minimalists recognize that cluttering their time and attention with too many devices, apps, and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation. 
* Principle #2: Optimization is important. Digital minimalists believe that deciding a particular technology supports something they value is only the first step. To truly extract its full potential benefit, it’s necessary to think carefully about how they’ll use the technology. 
* Principle #3: Intentionality is satisfying. Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being more intentional about how they engage with new technologies. This source of satisfaction is independent of the specific decisions they make and is one of the biggest reasons that minimalism tends to be immensely meaningful to its practitioners.
Digital Declutter
* Declutter process 
   * Step 1: Put aside a thirty-day period during which you will take a break from optional technologies in your life.
   * Step 2: During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful. 
   * Step 3: At the end of the break, reintroduce optional technologies into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine what value it serves in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value.
* Step 1 in practice 
   * The digital declutter focuses primarily on new technologies, which describes apps, sites, and tools delivered through a computer or mobile phone screen. You should probably also include video games and streaming video in this category. 
   * Take a thirty-day break from any of these technologies that you deem “optional”—meaning that you can step away from them without creating harm or major problems in either your professional or personal life. In some cases, you’ll abstain from using the optional technology altogether, while in other cases you might specify a set of operating procedures that dictate exactly when and how you use the technology during the process. 
   * In the end, you’re left with a list of banned technologies along with relevant operating procedures. Write this down and put it somewhere where you’ll see it every day. Clarity in what you’re allowed and not allowed to do during the declutter will prove key to its success.
* Step 2 in practice 
   * You will probably find the first week or two of your digital declutter to be difficult, and fight urges to check technologies you’re not allowed to check. These feelings, however, will pass, and this resulting sense of detox will prove useful when it comes time to make clear decisions at the end of the declutter. 
   * The goal of a digital declutter, however, is not simply to enjoy time away from intrusive technology. During this month long process, you must aggressively explore higher-quality activities to fill in the time left vacant by the optional technologies you’re avoiding. This period should be one of strenuous activity and experimentation. 
   * You want to arrive at the end of the declutter having rediscovered the type of activities that generate real satisfaction, enabling you to confidently craft a better life—one in which technology serves only a supporting role for more meaningful ends.
* Step 3 in practice 
   * Your month long break from optional technologies resets your digital life. You can now rebuild it from scratch in a much more intentional and minimalist manner. To do so, apply a three-step technology screen to each optional technology you’re thinking about reintroducing. 
      * The Minimalist Technology Screen: to allow an optional technology back into your life at the end of the digital declutter, it must:
         * Serve something you deeply value (offering some benefit is not enough).
         * Be the best way to use technology to serve this value (if it’s not, replace it with something better). 
         * Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies when and how you use it.
   * This process will help you cultivate a digital life in which new technologies serve your deeply held values as opposed to subverting them without your permission. It is in this careful reintroduction that you make the intentional decisions that will define you as a digital minimalist.
Spend Time Alone
* Key concept(s): 
   * Regular doses of solitude mixes with our default mode of sociality are critical to flourishing as a human
   * Humans are not designed to be constantly wired/connected
   * Solitude deprivation: a state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds.
* Putting into practice: 
   * leave your phone at home 
   * go on long walks by yourself sans phone
   * write letters to yourself
Don’t Click “Like”
* Key concept(s): 
   * We require high bandwidth social interaction such as analog conversation. Social media use correlates with depression and reduces the time we have for deep meaningful connection and conversation with others
   * We should use social media or tech to simplify the planning and logistics of arranging times for conversation, otherwise non-f2f comma do not count as conversation and will not help active our true social needs
* Putting into practice: 
   * To adopt the baseline rule that you’ll no longer use social media as a tool for low-quality relationship nudges.
   * Consolidate texting to certain blocks of time 
   * Conversation office hours where you tell people particular times you’ll be available for calls or in person
Reclaim Leisure
* Key concept(s): 
   * Bennett Principle - prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption
   * Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world
   * Seek activities that require real-world structured social interaction
* Putting into practice: 
   * Fix/build something each week
   * Schedule low-quality leisure
   * Join something
   * Follow your leisure plans and create SMART goals with higher level objectives to accomplish your leisure goals
Join the Attention Resistance
* Key concept(s): 
   * You have to be very purposeful to beat the tech giants who are monetizing your attention
* Putting into practice: 
   * Remove social media apps from phone 
   * Use your phone / comp for a single purpose at a time (If you want to join the attention resistance, one of the most important things you can therefore do is follow Fred Stutzman’s lead and transform your devices—laptops, tablets, phones—into computers that are general purpose in the long run, but are effectively single purpose in any given moment. This practice suggests that you use tools like Freedom to aggressively control when you allow yourself access to any website or app supported by a company that profits from your attention.)
   * Use social media like a professional to extract the most value out of it 
   * Be focused in your consumption of media and read viewpoints counter to yours
